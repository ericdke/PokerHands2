## Techniques

- Compute a rank for each card

- Compute a rank for each possible 5 cards hand

- Permutations of all 5 cards hands among the 7 cards in play

- Sort, filter, deduplicate the results

- Compare ranks by byte matching

- Reorder and extract results

## Demo app

A list of a all-in heads-up simulator. Two players, with random cards, go all-in each round.
